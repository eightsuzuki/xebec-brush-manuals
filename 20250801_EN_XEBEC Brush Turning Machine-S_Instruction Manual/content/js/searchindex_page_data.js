Warning and Caution Logos WARNING indicates a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury CAUTION indicates practices that may cause injuries and damage Symbols Obey all safety messages that follow this symbol to avoid possible injury or death. This is the safety alert symbol. It is used to alert you to potential physical injury hazards. Operator Safety Protection Using this product can result in severe injuries and damage. To prevent these, take appropriate safety measures and use the product with caution. The product may break, fracture or be dislodged from the machine tool causing operator injury or loss of sight. It may also cause damage to the machine tool, jig, fixture or workpiece. Dust and cutting chips generated when using this product can cause blindness and injury. Dust and particles generated by this product can cause lung damage, skin irritation, and allergies. Discontinue use immediately in the event of abnormal vibration or other abnormal conditions. Continued use of the product under abnormal conditions may cause it to break or be dislodged, resulting in potential injury or loss of sight. The tip of the tool may become overheated when it is applied to a workpiece for a prolonged period of time. This may result in ceramic fiber bristles breaking loose and possible operator injury or loss of sight. Adjust the machining time to prevent the workpiece from overheating. DO NOT touch the machined area of the workpiece with bare hands. Ensure the product is used within the standard machining parameters. Exceeding these parameters may cause the product to break, fracture, or be dislodged from the machine tool, leading to operator injury or loss of sight. When setting the depth of cut, make sure that there is no interference between this product and the workpiece. Interference may cause bristles and other components of this product to break, fracture or be dislodged from the machine tool and cause operator injuries or loss of sight. {include} を描画できません 挿入するページが見つかりません。 Chips and Dust Use a dust collector or other means to collect cutting chips, dust, and other substances to prevent them from scattering into the surrounding environment. Attention to the Work Area Install an enclosure to prevent persons other than the operator from entering the work area, and ensure that all persons in the work area are wearing protective gears. Children should not be allowed to enter the work area. Keep the work area floor clean at all times to prevent the risk of slipping or tripping on cutting chips, dust, cutting fluids, coolant, or other substances. Be aware of the fire risk caused by heating, sparks, or other factors when using this product. Do not use the product in the proximity of flammable liquids or in explosion-proof areas. Allow all fire prevention measures. Pre-Use Inspection Perform a test run after setting up the Brush on the machine, making sure it is secured firmly, and there is no vibration or other abnormalities. Make sure that the Brush is free of any visible damage or abnormality prior to use. Notes for When Setting up This Product on the Machine Refer to the instruction manual of the machine and tool holder when setting up the Brush on the machine. If the product is not clamped properly, this product may be dislodged from the tool holder during in operation, causing operator blindness or injury. Dust and chips generated by using the product can affect the sliding parts of the machine tool. Make sure to remove dust and chips by using a sludge collection system, an oil skimmer or other means. Make sure to use a tool holder that is the right size for the square shank of this product. Make sure to use the product on a machine tool that can control rotational speed.','warningandcautionlogosthemeaningsoftheindicationsandsymbolsrelatedtomatterswhichmustbeobservedintoensurethesafetyofthisproductareasdetailedbelow.warningandcautionlogoswarningindicatesahazardoussituationwhich,ifnotavoided,couldresultindeathorseriousinjurycautionindicatespracticesthatmaycauseinjuriesanddamagesymbolsobeyallsafetymessagesthatfollowthissymboltoavoidpossibleinjuryordeath.thisisthesafetyalertsymbol.itisusedtoalertyoutopotentialphysicalinjuryhazards.operatorsafetyprotectionusingthisproductcanresultinsevereinjuriesanddamage.topreventthese,takeappropriatesafetymeasuresandusetheproductwithcaution.theproductmaybreak,fractureorbedislodgedfromthemachinetoolcausingoperatorinjuryorlossofsight.itmayalsocausedamagetothemachinetool,jig,fixtureorworkpiece.dustandcuttingchipsgeneratedwhenusingthisproductcancauseblindnessandinjury.dustandparticlesgeneratedbythisproductcancauselungdamage,skinirritation,andallergies.discontinueuseimmediatelyintheeventofabnormalvibrationorotherabnormalconditions.continueduseoftheproductunderabnormalconditionsmaycauseittobreakorbedislodged,resultinginpotentialinjuryorlossofsight.thetipofthetoolmaybecomeoverheatedwhenitisappliedtoaworkpieceforaprolongedperiodoftime.thismayresultinceramicfiberbristlesbreakinglooseandpossibleoperatorinjuryorlossofsight.adjustthemachiningtimetopreventtheworkpiecefromoverheating.donottouchthemachinedareaoftheworkpiecewithbarehands.ensuretheproductisusedwithinthestandardmachiningparameters.exceedingtheseparametersmaycausetheproducttobreak,fracture,orbedislodgedfromthemachinetool,leadingtooperatorinjuryorlossofsight.whensettingthedepthofcut,makesurethatthereisnointerferencebetweenthisproductandtheworkpiece.interferencemaycausebristlesandothercomponentsofthisproducttobreak,fractureorbedislodgedfromthemachinetoolandcauseoperatorinjuriesorlossofsight.{include}を描画できません挿入するページが見つかりません。chipsanddustuseadustcollectororothermeanstocollectcuttingchips,dust,andothersubstancestopreventthemfromscatteringintothesurroundingenvironment.attentiontotheworkareainstallanenclosuretopreventpersonsotherthantheoperatorfromenteringtheworkarea,andensurethatallpersonsintheworkareaarewearingprotectivegears.childrenshouldnotbeallowedtoentertheworkarea.keeptheworkareafloorcleanatalltimestopreventtheriskofslippingortrippingoncuttingchips,dust,cuttingfluids,coolant,orothersubstances.beawareofthefireriskcausedbyheating,sparks,orotherfactorswhenusingthisproduct.donotusetheproductintheproximityofflammableliquidsorinexplosion-proofareas.allowallfirepreventionmeasures.pre-useinspectionperformatestrunaftersettingupthebrushonthemachine,makingsureitissecuredfirmly,andthereisnovibrationorotherabnormalities.makesurethatthebrushisfreeofanyvisibledamageorabnormalitypriortouse.notesforwhensettingupthisproductonthemachinerefertotheinstructionmanualofthemachineandtoolholderwhensettingupthebrushonthemachine.iftheproductisnotclampedproperly,thisproductmaybedislodgedfromthetoolholderduringinoperation,causingoperatorblindnessorinjury.dustandchipsgeneratedbyusingtheproductcanaffecttheslidingpartsofthemachinetool.makesuretoremovedustandchipsbyusingasludgecollectionsystem,anoilskimmerorothermeans.makesuretouseatoolholderthatistherightsizeforthesquareshankofthisproduct.makesuretousetheproductonamachinetoolthatcancontrolrotationalspeed.','247235471.html'];

Do not exceed the maximum depth of cut specified for the Brush angle in use When using the product on an intermittent surface, the maximum depth of cut is 0.5 mm. The figure below shows examples of continuous and intermittent surfaces. The holder will collide with the workpiece and the tool may be damagedif the Brush is used when shorter than the usable bristle height (ℓ). Always refer to the chart below to determine the correct usable bristle height (ℓ)for the Brush angle used and the type of machining.

Rotate the workpiece in CW (clockwise) and CCW (counterclockwise) directions as needed. Minimize burr size as much as possible before using the product. If burrs are too large, tool wear will be accelerated and the tool life shortened. As shown in the figure below, burrs are more easily removed when they protrude vertically from the workpiece surface.
