Warning and Caution Logos WARNING indicates a hazardous situation which, if not avoided, could result in death or serious injury CAUTION indicates practices that may cause injuries and damage Symbols Obey all safety messages that follow this symbol to avoid possible injury or death. This is the safety alert symbol. It is used to alert you to potential physical injury hazards. Operator Safety Protection Using this product can result in severe injuries and damage. To prevent these, take appropriate safety measures and use the product with caution. The product may break, fracture or be dislodged from the machine tool causing operator injury or loss of sight. It may also cause damage to the machine tool, jig, fixture or workpiece. Dust and cutting chips generated when using this product can cause blindness and injury. Dust and particles generated by this product can cause lung damage, skin irritation, and allergies. Discontinue use immediately in the event of abnormal vibration or other abnormal conditions. Continued use of the product under abnormal conditions may cause it to break or be dislodged, resulting in potential injury or loss of sight. The tip of the tool may become overheated when it is applied to a workpiece for a prolonged period of time. This may result in ceramic fiber bristles breaking loose and possible operator injury or loss of sight. Adjust the machining time to prevent the workpiece from overheating. DO NOT touch the machined area of the workpiece with bare hands. Ensure the product is used within the standard machining parameters. Exceeding these parameters may cause the product to break, fracture, or be dislodged from the machine tool, leading to operator injury or loss of sight. Make sure that the product is the appropriate size for the workpiece main bore diameter. If the product is not the appropriate size for the workpiece main bore diameter, it may break and cause operator injuries or loss of sight. Wear protective gear Wear protective gear such as goggles, a face mask, gloves, and earmuffs when using this product. Additionally, ensure your skin is covered with clothing. Chips and Dust Use a dust collector or other means to collect cutting chips, dust, and other substances to prevent them from scattering into the surrounding environment. Attention to the Work Area Install an enclosure to prevent persons other than the operator from entering the work area, and ensure that all persons in the work area are wearing protective gears. Children should not be allowed to enter the work area. Keep the work area floor clean at all times to prevent the risk of slipping or tripping on cutting chips, dust, cutting fluids, coolant, or other substances. Be aware of the fire risk caused by heating, sparks, or other factors when using this product. Do not use the product in the proximity of flammable liquids or in explosion-proof areas. Allow all fire prevention measures. Pre-Use Inspection Perform a test run after setting up the Brush on the machine and making sure there is no looseness, vibration or any other abnormality. Make sure that the Brush is free of any visible damage or abnormality prior to use. Notes for When Setting up This Product on the Machine Make sure to hold the shank of this product by 30 mm or more with the tool holder. Otherwise, vibrations may cause this product to fall off from the tool holder. It may cause operator blindness or injury. Dust and chips generated by using the product can affect the sliding parts of the machine tool. Make sure to remove dust and chips by using a sludge collection system, an oil skimmer or other means. Make sure to use a tool holder that is the right size for the shank diameter of this product. Make sure to use the product on a machine tool that can control rotational speed.','warningandcautionlogosthemeaningsoftheindicationsandsymbolsrelatedtomatterswhichmustbeobservedintoensurethesafetyofthisproductareasdetailedbelow.warningandcautionlogoswarningindicatesahazardoussituationwhich,ifnotavoided,couldresultindeathorseriousinjurycautionindicatespracticesthatmaycauseinjuriesanddamagesymbolsobeyallsafetymessagesthatfollowthissymboltoavoidpossibleinjuryordeath.thisisthesafetyalertsymbol.itisusedtoalertyoutopotentialphysicalinjuryhazards.operatorsafetyprotectionusingthisproductcanresultinsevereinjuriesanddamage.topreventthese,takeappropriatesafetymeasuresandusetheproductwithcaution.theproductmaybreak,fractureorbedislodgedfromthemachinetoolcausingoperatorinjuryorlossofsight.itmayalsocausedamagetothemachinetool,jig,fixtureorworkpiece.dustandcuttingchipsgeneratedwhenusingthisproductcancauseblindnessandinjury.dustandparticlesgeneratedbythisproductcancauselungdamage,skinirritation,andallergies.discontinueuseimmediatelyintheeventofabnormalvibrationorotherabnormalconditions.continueduseoftheproductunderabnormalconditionsmaycauseittobreakorbedislodged,resultinginpotentialinjuryorlossofsight.thetipofthetoolmaybecomeoverheatedwhenitisappliedtoaworkpieceforaprolongedperiodoftime.thismayresultinceramicfiberbristlesbreakinglooseandpossibleoperatorinjuryorlossofsight.adjustthemachiningtimetopreventtheworkpiecefromoverheating.donottouchthemachinedareaoftheworkpiecewithbarehands.ensuretheproductisusedwithinthestandardmachiningparameters.exceedingtheseparametersmaycausetheproducttobreak,fracture,orbedislodgedfromthemachinetool,leadingtooperatorinjuryorlossofsight.makesurethattheproductistheappropriatesizefortheworkpiecemainborediameter.iftheproductisnottheappropriatesizefortheworkpiecemainborediameter,itmaybreakandcauseoperatorinjuriesorlossofsight.wearprotectivegearwearprotectivegearsuchasgoggles,afacemask,gloves,andearmuffswhenusingthisproduct.additionally,ensureyourskiniscoveredwithclothing.chipsanddustuseadustcollectororothermeanstocollectcuttingchips,dust,andothersubstancestopreventthemfromscatteringintothesurroundingenvironment.attentiontotheworkareainstallanenclosuretopreventpersonsotherthantheoperatorfromenteringtheworkarea,andensurethatallpersonsintheworkareaarewearingprotectivegears.childrenshouldnotbeallowedtoentertheworkarea.keeptheworkareafloorcleanatalltimestopreventtheriskofslippingortrippingoncuttingchips,dust,cuttingfluids,coolant,orothersubstances.beawareofthefireriskcausedbyheating,sparks,orotherfactorswhenusingthisproduct.donotusetheproductintheproximityofflammableliquidsorinexplosion-proofareas.allowallfirepreventionmeasures.pre-useinspectionperformatestrunaftersettingupthebrushonthemachineandmakingsurethereisnolooseness,vibrationoranyotherabnormality.makesurethatthebrushisfreeofanyvisibledamageorabnormalitypriortouse.notesforwhensettingupthisproductonthemachinemakesuretoholdtheshankofthisproductby30mmormorewiththetoolholder.otherwise,vibrationsmaycausethisproducttofallofffromthetoolholder.itmaycauseoperatorblindnessorinjury.dustandchipsgeneratedbyusingtheproductcanaffecttheslidingpartsofthemachinetool.makesuretoremovedustandchipsbyusingasludgecollectionsystem,anoilskimmerorothermeans.makesuretouseatoolholderthatistherightsizefortheshankdiameterofthisproduct.makesuretousetheproductonamachinetoolthatcancontrolrotationalspeed.','271908984.html'];

If burrs are too large, the Brush may be damaged even if the depth of cut is less than the maximum (2 mm) listed in the table. If the Brush is used beyond the usable bristle height (ℓ), the Holder may interfere with the workpiece and the tool may be damaged. Uniform deburring and edge quality can be achieved by rotating the workpiece in both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. Rotate the workpiece in both directions as needed. Reduce the size of large burrs as much as possible before using the product. If burrs are too large, the tool wear will be quick and the tool life may be shortened. It is easier to remove burrs if their directions are vertical rather than horizontal. If burrs remain, try the followings: - Decrease the feed per revolution - Increase the number of passes','standardmachiningparametersstartingmachiningparameterscuttingspeed(m/min)60-250150feedperrevolution(mm/rev)0.1-0.50.3depthofcut(mm)0.5-2.01.0adjustthedepthofcutdependingontheburrsize(burrrootthicknessneedstobe0.1mmorless).ifburrsaretoolarge,thebrushmaybedamagedevenifthedepthofcutislessthanthemaximum(2mm)listedinthetable.ifthebrushisusedbeyondtheusablebristleheight(ℓ),theholdermayinterferewiththeworkpieceandthetoolmaybedamaged.uniformdeburringandedgequalitycanbeachievedbyrotatingtheworkpieceinbothclockwiseandcounter-clockwisedirections.rotatetheworkpieceinbothdirectionsasneeded.reducethesizeoflargeburrsasmuchaspossiblebeforeusingtheproduct.ifburrsaretoolarge,thetoolwearwillbequickandthetoollifemaybeshortened.itiseasiertoremoveburrsiftheirdirectionsareverticalratherthanhorizontal.ifburrsremain,trythefollowings:-decreasethefeedperrevolution-increasethenumberofpasses','271909014.html'];
